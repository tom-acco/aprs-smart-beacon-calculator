# APRS Smart Beacon Calculator
[https://tom-acco.github.io/aprs-smart-beacon-calculator/](https://tom-acco.github.io/aprs-smart-beacon-calculator/)

I wanted a way to view results of the smart beacon calculations implemented in [Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-TWR](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-TWR) against the calculations implemented in [t52ta6ek/APRS-SmartBeaconing-Worksheet](https://github.com/t52ta6ek/APRS-SmartBeaconing-Worksheet).

## Xinyuan-LilyGO/T-TWR
txInterval = (15 * highSpeed) / speed

## t52ta6ek/APRS-SmartBeaconing-Worksheet
txInterval = (fastInterval * highSpeed) / speed

# Got a better method? [Send it](https://github.com/tom-acco/aprs-smart-beacon-calculator/issues)
